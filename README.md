# Custom Board LED Patterns
## This project features a custom ATmega328P microcontroller board programmed in C. The board includes 4 LEDs and 2 buttons. The LEDs support multiple blinking modes controlled by one of the buttons, while the other button serves as a reset.

Blinking Modes:

*   Default Mode: All LEDs blink simultaneously.
*   Shift Left: LEDs blink in sequence from left to right.
*   Shift Right: LEDs blink in sequence from right to left.
*   Alternate: LEDs blink alternately between odd and even positions.
  
The project demonstrates efficient use of button interrupts, state management, and LED control in embedded systems programming. Ideal for learning or expanding skills in microcontroller-based projects.
